# ExcelReadWrite
Using Apache POI to automate reading and writing excel data files

Learned to use Apache POI via maven. 
This project reads input from an existing .xlsx document and writes automated code depending on end-user's preferences.
From user-defined data, I was able alter excel cell data and highlight cells which fit a specific criteria (defined in excelfunctions)

Improvements:
  -Can create a UI
  -Can incorporate more complex functions of pattern recognition
